Bubble Popper Game
Introduction
Bubble Popper is a simple browser-based game where the player's goal is to pop bubbles by clicking on them. The game includes a timer, score tracking, and a dynamic bubble grid.

Features
Hit, Timer, and Score Display: The top panel of the game displays essential information, including the current "Hit" target, the remaining "Timer" time, and the player's "Score."

Interactive Bubbles: Bubbles with random numbers are generated at the bottom of the screen. The player must click on the bubble with the number matching the current "Hit" target to score points.

Score System: Players earn points for successfully hitting the correct bubble and lose points for incorrect clicks. The score is updated in real-time.

Timer: The game has a countdown timer that adds an element of urgency. If the timer reaches zero, the game ends.

Game Over Screen: When the timer runs out, a "Game Over" message is displayed, and no more bubbles appear.

How to Play
Matching Bubbles: Click on the bubble with the number that matches the "Hit" target to score points.

Scoring: Successfully hitting the correct bubble adds points to the score, while hitting the wrong bubble deducts points. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible.

Timer: Keep an eye on the timer; if it reaches zero, the game ends.
